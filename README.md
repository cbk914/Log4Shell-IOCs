# Log4Shell-IOCs

Members of the Curated Intelligence Trust Group have compiled a list of IOC feeds and threat reports focused on the recent Log4Shell exploit targeting CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j. ([Blog](https://www.curatedintel.org/2021/08/welcome.html) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CuratedIntel) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/curatedintelligence/))

#### Analyst Comments:

- 2021-12-13
  - IOCs shared by these feeds are `LOW-TO-MEDIUM CONFIDENCE` we strongly recommend `NOT` adding them to a blocklist
  - These could potentially be used for `THREAT HUNTING` and could be added to a `WATCHLIST`
  - Curated Intel members at various organisations recommend to `FOCUS ON POST-EXPLOITATION ACTIVITY` by threats leveraging Log4Shell (ex. threat actors, botnets)
  - IOCs include JNDI requests (LDAP, but also DNS and RMI), cryptominers, DDoS bots, as well as Meterpreter or Cobalt Strike
  - Critical IOCs to monitor also include attacks using DNS-based exfiltration of environment variables (e.g. keys or tokens), a Curated Intel member shared an [example](https://twitter.com/captainGeech42/status/1470055184449613829)
- 2021-12-14
  - Curated Intel members profiled [active exploitation](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs#threat-profiling) threats
- 2021-12-15
  - Curated Intel members parsed `MEDIUM CONFIDENCE FEEDS` to be `MISP COMPATIBLE` with the help of the [KPMG-Egyde CTI Team](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/tree/main/KPMG_Log4Shell_Feeds)
  - Curated Intel members profiled active [threat groups (nation states and organized crime)](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/blob/main/README.md#threat-groups)
- 2021-12-16
  - Curated Intel members confirmed the previously unnamed "[New Ransomware](https://twitter.com/80vul/status/1470272820571963392)" is actually "[TellYouThePass Ransomware](https://www.curatedintel.org/2021/12/tellyouthepass-ransomware-via-log4shell.html)", mostly targeting Chinese infrastructure
- 2021-12-17
  - Curated Intel members parsed `VETTED IOCs` with the help of the [Equinix Threat Analysis Center (ETAC)](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/blob/main/ETAC_Log4Shell_Analysis/ETAC_Vetted_Log4Shell_IOCs.csv)
  - ETAC has also [shared a diagram](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/blob/main/ETAC_Log4Shell_Analysis/ETAC_Identified_Threats_Log4Shell.jpg) of threat actors, malware, and botnets, leveraging Log4Shell in the wild
- 2021-12-20
  - ETAC has added [MITRE ATT&CK TTPs](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/tree/main/ETAC_Log4Shell_Analysis/ETAC_Log4Shell_ThreatActor_TTPs) of Threat Actors leveraging Log4Shell
  - Curated Intel members parsed `ALIENVAULT OTX MENTIONS` to be `MISP COMPATIBLE` with the help of the [KPMG-Egyde CTI Team](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/tree/main/KPMG_Log4Shell_Feeds/MISP-CSV_AlienVaultOTX_Unfiltered)
- 2021-12-21
  - Curated Intel members parsed `VULNERABLE PRODUCT LISTS` to be `CSV+XLSX COMPATIBLE` with an [automated workflow](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/tree/main/CI_Log4Shell_Products), pulling from [NCSC-NL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/main/software/README.md) + [CISA](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/blob/develop/README.md) + [SwitHak](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592/raw/2616607b598f9eba8b82ff14e14022a8de70ca49/20211210-TLP-WHITE_LOG4J.md)
- 2021-12-22
  - Curated Intel members added very basic `FALSE-POSITIVE FILTERING` for [threat hunting feed](https://github.com/curated-intel/Log4Shell-IOCs/tree/main/KPMG_Log4Shell_Feeds) outputs, using selected [MISP warning lists](https://github.com/MISP/misp-warninglists), primarily to remove false-positives of large DNS resolvers (among others)
- 2021-12-29
  - Added Securonix Autonomous Threat Sweep vetted IoC's and TTP's
